* Big revamp of colour palettes: updated colours and names of existing palettes (now more colourblind-friendly), dropped old palettes ("glue") and added new palettes ("bodied"). Palettes are now defined as qualitative, sequential or diverging.
* Added functionality to interpolate between colours for sequential and diverging palettes.

* Added six colour palettes.
* Added functions to list available palettes, make palettes, visualise palettes, and print palette info.
